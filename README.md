# PATHFINDING-VISUALIZATION-

It shows the implementation of A* pathfinding algorithm . It is used to find the shortest path between 2 points in a 2 dimensional matrix . It is assumed that the 2D matrix is a complete graph . Please choose the start points such that x>1 and y>1 . Please choose the ending points to be such that x<49 and y<49 .
